        _Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
back, with drawn curtains over it._

BARON RAFF. <br>
 What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully! <br>


PRINCE PETRO. <br>
My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
seems to get married three times a week <br>

MARQ. DE POIV.<br> I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.<br>

BARON RAFF. <br>Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
the funeral begins to-day.<br>

CZAR <br>(_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
order (_counting them_) six extra places.<br>

CZAR.<br> I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the
people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron,
always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince
Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that
excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be
merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each
session are sent to you regularly.<br>

CZAR.<br> But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are
diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.<br>

COLONEL. <br>[6]For the cordon of[6] guards, Sire, on night duty around the
palace.<br>

PAGE.<br> It is after eleven, Sire. Shall I take the first watch in your
room to-night?<br>
