    <h4> ACT IV </h4>
    <p>
        <p class="stage-direction">_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
            back, with drawn curtains over it._</p>

    <h5 class="BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. <br></h5>
    <p class="speech" >What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully! <br></p>


    <h5 class="PRINCEPETRO">PRINCE PETRO. <br></h5>
    <p class="speech">My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
        seems to get married three times a week <br>
    </p>

    <h5 class="MARQDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.<br> </h5>
    <p class="speech">I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.<br></p>

    <h5 class="BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. <br></h5>
    <p class="speech">Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
        the funeral begins to-day.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="CZAR">CZAR <br></h5>
    <p class="speech">(_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
        order (_counting them_) six extra places.<br>
    </p>

    <h5 class="CZAR">CZAR.<br> </h5>
    <p class="speech">I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the
        people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron,
        always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince
        Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that
        excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be
        merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each
        session are sent to you regularly.<br>
    </p>

    <h5 class="CZAR">CZAR.<br> </h5>
    <p class="speech">But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are
        diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.<br>
    </p>

    <h5 class="COLONEL">COLONEL. <br></h5>
   <p class="speech"> [6]For the cordon of[6] guards, Sire, on night duty around the
    palace.<br>
   </p>

    <h5 class="PAGE">PAGE.<br> </h5>
    <p class="speech">It is after eleven, Sire. Shall I take the first watch in your
        room to-night?<br>
    </p>
