        It is after eleven, Sire. Shall I take the first watch in your
    room to-night?
    </p>

    <h5 class="CZAR">CZAR. <br></h5>
    <p class="speech">Why should you watch me, boy? The stars are my best sentinels.</p>

    <h5 class="PAGE">PAGE. <br> </h5>
    <p class="speech">It was your Imperial father's wish, Sire, never to be left alone
        while he slept.</p>

    <p class="speech">My father was troubled with bad dreams. Go, get to your bed, boy;
    it is nigh on midnight, and these late hours will spoil those red
    cheeks. (_PAGE tries to kiss his hand._) Nay, nay; we have played
    together too often as children for that. Oh, to breathe the same air as

    sun vanished from my day.</p>

    <p class="speech">Sire,--Alexis,--let me stay with[8] you to-night! There is some
        danger over you; I feel there is.</p>
